	File size set to 159744 kB
	Record Size 1024 kB
	Setting no_unlink
	Include fsync in write timing
	Command line used: ./iozone -t 32 -i 0 -s 156M -r 1M -w -e
	Output is in kBytes/sec
	Time Resolution = 0.000001 seconds.
	Processor cache size set to 1024 kBytes.
	Processor cache line size set to 32 bytes.
	File stride size set to 17 * record size.
	Throughput test with 32 processes
	Each process writes a 159744 kByte file in 1024 kByte records

	Children see throughput for 32 initial writers 	=  465924.73 kB/sec
	Parent sees throughput for 32 initial writers 	=  448997.19 kB/sec
	Min throughput per process 			=   13820.76 kB/sec 
	Max throughput per process 			=   15713.68 kB/sec
	Avg throughput per process 			=   14560.15 kB/sec
	Min xfer 					=  143360.00 kB

	Children see throughput for 32 rewriters 	=  492045.87 kB/sec
	Parent sees throughput for 32 rewriters 	=  484500.01 kB/sec
	Min throughput per process 			=   15141.04 kB/sec 
	Max throughput per process 			=   15984.61 kB/sec
	Avg throughput per process 			=   15376.43 kB/sec
	Min xfer 					=  159744.00 kB
