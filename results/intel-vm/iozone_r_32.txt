	File size set to 159744 kB
	Record Size 1024 kB
	Setting no_unlink
	Include fsync in write timing
	Command line used: ./iozone -t 32 -i 1 -s 156M -r 1M -w -e
	Output is in kBytes/sec
	Time Resolution = 0.000001 seconds.
	Processor cache size set to 1024 kBytes.
	Processor cache line size set to 32 bytes.
	File stride size set to 17 * record size.
	Throughput test with 32 processes
	Each process writes a 159744 kByte file in 1024 kByte records

	Children see throughput for 32 readers 		= 57505954.88 kB/sec
	Parent sees throughput for 32 readers 		= 55987080.62 kB/sec
	Min throughput per process 			=  675998.25 kB/sec 
	Max throughput per process 			= 2419998.75 kB/sec
	Avg throughput per process 			= 1797061.09 kB/sec
	Min xfer 					=   45056.00 kB

	Children see throughput for 32 re-readers 	= 14346535.16 kB/sec
	Parent sees throughput for 32 re-readers 	= 14144870.85 kB/sec
	Min throughput per process 			=  339703.88 kB/sec 
	Max throughput per process 			= 1218860.88 kB/sec
	Avg throughput per process 			=  448329.22 kB/sec
	Min xfer 					=   45056.00 kB
