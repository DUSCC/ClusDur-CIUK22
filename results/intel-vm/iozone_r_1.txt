	File size set to 10485760 kB
	Record Size 1024 kB
	Setting no_unlink
	Include fsync in write timing
	Command line used: ./iozone -t 1 -i 1 -s 10G -r 1M -w -e
	Output is in kBytes/sec
	Time Resolution = 0.000001 seconds.
	Processor cache size set to 1024 kBytes.
	Processor cache line size set to 32 bytes.
	File stride size set to 17 * record size.
	Throughput test with 1 process
	Each process writes a 10485760 kByte file in 1024 kByte records

	Children see throughput for  1 readers 		= 7855667.50 kB/sec
	Parent sees throughput for  1 readers 		= 7853013.89 kB/sec
	Min throughput per process 			= 7855667.50 kB/sec 
	Max throughput per process 			= 7855667.50 kB/sec
	Avg throughput per process 			= 7855667.50 kB/sec
	Min xfer 					= 10485760.00 kB

	Children see throughput for 1 re-readers 	= 6420582.00 kB/sec
	Parent sees throughput for 1 re-readers 	= 6419032.94 kB/sec
	Min throughput per process 			= 6420582.00 kB/sec 
	Max throughput per process 			= 6420582.00 kB/sec
	Avg throughput per process 			= 6420582.00 kB/sec
	Min xfer 					= 10485760.00 kB
