	File size set to 159744 kB
	Record Size 1024 kB
	Setting no_unlink
	Include fsync in write timing
	Command line used: ./iozone -t 64 -i 1 -s 156M -r 1M -w -e
	Output is in kBytes/sec
	Time Resolution = 0.000001 seconds.
	Processor cache size set to 1024 kBytes.
	Processor cache line size set to 32 bytes.
	File stride size set to 17 * record size.
	Throughput test with 64 processes
	Each process writes a 159744 kByte file in 1024 kByte records

	Children see throughput for 64 readers 		= 46897264.33 kB/sec
	Parent sees throughput for 64 readers 		= 43645617.07 kB/sec
	Min throughput per process 			=  154513.69 kB/sec 
	Max throughput per process 			= 1877151.00 kB/sec
	Avg throughput per process 			=  732769.76 kB/sec
	Min xfer 					=   13312.00 kB

	Children see throughput for 64 re-readers 	= 9208132.16 kB/sec
	Parent sees throughput for 64 re-readers 	= 8799162.98 kB/sec
	Min throughput per process 			=   91489.23 kB/sec 
	Max throughput per process 			= 1037933.44 kB/sec
	Avg throughput per process 			=  143877.07 kB/sec
	Min xfer 					=   14336.00 kB
