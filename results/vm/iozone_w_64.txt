	File size set to 159744 kB
	Record Size 1024 kB
	Setting no_unlink
	Include fsync in write timing
	Command line used: ./iozone -t 64 -i 0 -s 156M -r 1M -w -e
	Output is in kBytes/sec
	Time Resolution = 0.000001 seconds.
	Processor cache size set to 1024 kBytes.
	Processor cache line size set to 32 bytes.
	File stride size set to 17 * record size.
	Throughput test with 64 processes
	Each process writes a 159744 kByte file in 1024 kByte records

	Children see throughput for 64 initial writers 	=  360695.50 kB/sec
	Parent sees throughput for 64 initial writers 	=  350173.97 kB/sec
	Min throughput per process 			=    5379.94 kB/sec 
	Max throughput per process 			=    5973.14 kB/sec
	Avg throughput per process 			=    5635.87 kB/sec
	Min xfer 					=  148480.00 kB

	Children see throughput for 64 rewriters 	=  394917.51 kB/sec
	Parent sees throughput for 64 rewriters 	=  388101.54 kB/sec
	Min throughput per process 			=    6064.26 kB/sec 
	Max throughput per process 			=    9007.58 kB/sec
	Avg throughput per process 			=    6170.59 kB/sec
	Min xfer 					=  159744.00 kB
