	File size set to 159744 kB
	Record Size 1024 kB
	Setting no_unlink
	Include fsync in write timing
	Command line used: ./iozone -t 64 -i 1 -s 156M -r 1M -w -e
	Output is in kBytes/sec
	Time Resolution = 0.000001 seconds.
	Processor cache size set to 1024 kBytes.
	Processor cache line size set to 32 bytes.
	File stride size set to 17 * record size.
	Throughput test with 64 processes
	Each process writes a 159744 kByte file in 1024 kByte records

	Children see throughput for 64 readers 		= 108879387.38 kB/sec
	Parent sees throughput for 64 readers 		= 92810178.28 kB/sec
	Min throughput per process 			=  739917.94 kB/sec 
	Max throughput per process 			= 7176311.00 kB/sec
	Avg throughput per process 			= 1701240.43 kB/sec
	Min xfer 					=   13312.00 kB

	Children see throughput for 64 re-readers 	= 69600276.78 kB/sec
	Parent sees throughput for 64 re-readers 	= 49243775.33 kB/sec
	Min throughput per process 			=  169301.42 kB/sec 
	Max throughput per process 			= 7418469.50 kB/sec
	Avg throughput per process 			= 1087504.32 kB/sec
